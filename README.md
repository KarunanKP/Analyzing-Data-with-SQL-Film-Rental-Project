# Analyzing-Data-with-SQL-Film-Rental-Project

Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to help the store owner make informed business decisions. To achieve this, I answered a series of critical questions using SQL queries, data interpretation, and problem-solving abilities. These questions included determining total revenue from rentals, analyzing rental patterns by month, identifying the most popular film category, and much more.

What I Did:
In this project, I primarily used SQL queries to extract valuable information from the database. I employed techniques like aggregate functions (SUM, AVG), date calculations, subqueries, and joins to answer various questions and generate insights. This project sharpened my SQL skills, particularly in data analysis, and taught me how to dissect complex problems step by step. It also honed my ability to translate real-world questions into actionable SQL queries, making data-driven decisions a tangible reality.

Project Overview:
This project was part of my coursework at Great Learning Career Academy, with guidance from my mentor, Ranjith Gomez. It involved the practical application of database management and SQL querying skills to assist a local film rental store owner in making informed business decisions. By delving into a complex database schema, I used SQL queries to calculate revenue, analyze rental patterns, identify popular film categories, and much more. This hands-on experience enhanced my data analysis and problem-solving abilities, reaffirming the power of data to drive effective decision-making.Objective: The primary objective of this project was to help the store owner make informed business decisions.
